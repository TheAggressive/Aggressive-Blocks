# Install a pinned Composer release after verifying its official SHA-256 digest.
#
# Composer was the last unpinned toolchain input. The wp-env WordPress image
# ships whatever Composer it was built with (2.7.6 at time of writing) while
# developers typically have a much newer one, so `composer.lock` metadata and
# dependency resolution depended on who ran the command. Everything else in the
# parity lane is pinned — Node (bin/ci/node.sh), WP-CLI (bin/ci/install-wp-cli.sh),
# PHP and WordPress (bin/ci/.wp-env.json) — so this closes the gap.
#
# Keep the version, URL, and checksum together so upgrades are explicit and
# reviewable. The digest is published at:
#   https://getcomposer.org/download/<version>/composer.phar.sha256sum
