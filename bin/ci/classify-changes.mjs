 * quantifiers, and under `some` a pattern prefixed with `!` does not exclude
 * anything — it is merely another way for a file to match. So the documented
 * `['**', '!languages/**']` filter matched every file, `code` was permanently
 * true, and the translations-only skip never once engaged.
 *
 * The action is therefore used only to produce the changed-file list. Every
 * decision made from that list is made here, where it can be proven.
